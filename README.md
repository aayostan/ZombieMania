4. Game Economy: spend experience on powerups (Time Est: ~5hrs) [probably nixing this because I don't want to interrupt gameplay]
   - need a pause screen where exchanges can be made (Time Est: ~3hrs) [Don't like this, interrupts gameplay!]
   - need to balance availability with difficulty (Time Est: ~2hrs)
   - Stretch: bullet go through (Time: ~0.75hrs), bullet explode, and bullet ricochet bonuses (Time Est: ~2hrs)
